      <h2>Core Bet</h2>
      <p>
        Indie hackers building 3+ MVPs per year will use a Reddit problem signal miner (even with limited subreddit coverage) because manually browsing Reddit for 30-40 hours per validation cycle is painful and expensive, and pattern extraction quality is the unsolved moat.
      </p>

      <h2>What It Tests</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Layer 1 of the Pre-build Intelligence Pipeline:</strong> Problem Signal Validation. Can we automate the extraction of real problem signals from Reddit at a quality level that matches or exceeds manual research?
      </p>

      <h2>Build Window</h2>
      <div class="detail-grid">
        <div class="detail-item">
          <div class="label">Timeline</div>
          <div class="value">Tuesday Feb 10 → Friday Feb 13, 2026</div>
        </div>

          <div class="value"><code>reddit-signals.theaiethos.com</code></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>A stranger can visit the URL and generate a pain point report with zero instructions</li>
        <li>Extraction accuracy >60% (12+/20 extracted pain points should be legitimate, actionable)</li>
        <li>Processing completes in <3 minutes from submit to full report display</li>
        <li>We actually use it ourselves for next Monday's research</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Stack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Next.js 15 (App Router)</li>
        <li>TypeScript (strict mode)</li>
        <li>No database (stateless, ephemeral reports)</li>
        <li>No auth (public tool)</li>
        <li>Claude 3.5 Sonnet API for pain point extraction</li>
        <li>rss-parser for Reddit RSS feed scraping</li>
        <li>Deployed on Vercel</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Constraints</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5 curated subreddits only</strong> — r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, r/startups, r/indiehackers, r/ProductManagement (avoids expensive Reddit API)</li>
        <li><strong>RSS feeds for data access</strong> — Free, reliable, avoids API costs that killed GummySearch</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly batch processing</strong> — Not real-time monitoring</li>
        <li><strong>Stateless design</strong> — No user accounts, no saved searches</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kill Criteria</h2>
      <p>
        If extraction accuracy <60% after Tuesday spike, OR if RSS feed data is insufficient, OR if the structured output isn't more useful than 30 minutes of manual Reddit browsing — simplify or kill the project.

    <section class="article">
      <p><em>Completed Monday Feb 9, 2026 • 2.5 hours</em></p>

      <h2>Problem Signal</h2>
      <p><strong>Who has this problem most acutely?</strong> Solo indie hackers and early-stage founders (pre-product-market fit) who are shipping multiple MVPs per year. Specifically: technical founders who can build quickly but struggle with customer discovery, repeat builders who've launched multiple products without traction, and bootstrap founders without budget for expensive research tools ($59-$hundreds/month).</p>

      <h3>Patterns Across Complaints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Wasted time"</strong> appears repeatedly - builders shipping without validation, then starting over</li>
        <li><strong>"I spent weeks"</strong> researching but still got it wrong - research is time-consuming AND unreliable when done manually</li>
        <li><strong>"Nobody needed it"</strong> - builders shipping solutions looking for problems instead of solving real pain</li>
        <li><strong>Overconfidence blindness</strong> - "I know it will work" prevents proper validation</li>
        <li><strong>Gap between intent and action</strong> - surveys and hypotheticals don't predict actual behavior</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Signals For</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Active existing market</strong> - GummySearch built a profitable business around this exact problem (multiple pricing tiers, users paying $29-$59/month), proving willingness to pay</li>
        <li><strong>Reddit is recognized as THE source</strong> - multiple articles, tools, and founder advice consistently point to Reddit as the best place for authentic problem discovery</li>
        <li><strong>Manual process is painful</strong> - founders spend "30-40 hours taking notes" on Reddit to find pain points</li>
        <li><strong>Validation gap is costing founders months</strong> - "validate for a month vs. build for 6 months" framing shows the stakes</li>
        <li><strong>This tests Layer 1 of the pipeline</strong> - directly validates whether problem signal validation can be automated</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Signals Against</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>GummySearch is shutting down</strong> - the category leader announced closure (no new purchases after Nov 30, service ends late 2026). Red flag that needs investigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Reddit API is expensive/restricted</strong> - Free tier is basically unusable. Paid tier "starts at thousands per month." Major cost/feasibility risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Scraping is fragile</strong> - workarounds exist (RSS feeds, browser automation) but they're brittle and could break if Reddit changes their frontend</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive landscape is already crowded</strong> - PainOnSocial, Peekdit, BigIdeasDB, plus general scraping tools</li>
        <li><strong>Single-source tool has limited moat</strong> - if we only scrape Reddit, competitors can copy quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Self-referential risk</strong> - building a tool to help us build better tools. Easy to over-optimize for our own workflow</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Tool</th>
            <th>Pricing</th>
            <th>Core Bet</th>
            <th>What They Skip</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>GummySearch</td>
            <td>$29-$59/mo (shutting down)</td>
            <td>Reddit audience research</td>
            <td>API-dependent, shutting down suggests cost issues</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PainOnSocial</td>
            <td>"More affordable"</td>
            <td>AI-powered pain point extraction, 0-100 scoring</td>
            <td>Curated communities only, single platform</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Peekdit</td>
            <td>Free + paid tiers</td>
            <td>Research Mode auto-captures as you scroll</td>
            <td>Manual/semi-manual, not fully automated</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><strong>Why hasn't this been built well yet?</strong> Reddit API cost structure killed the leader. GummySearch shutting down after building a working business suggests the 2023 API pricing changes ($thousands/month for meaningful access) destroyed unit economics. The technical challenge isn't extraction — it's sustainable, affordable data access at scale.</p>

      <h2>Technical Feasibility</h2>
      <p><strong>MVP Scale Cost Estimate:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scrape 50 subreddits/week via RSS: <strong>$0</strong> (free)</li>
        <li>Claude API for pattern extraction (estimated 500K tokens/week): <strong>~$7.50-$37.50/week</strong></li>
        <li>Hosting (Vercel): <strong>$0</strong> (free tier sufficient for MVP)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Hardest technical part:</strong> Problem signal extraction quality. Reddit threads are noisy - memes, jokes, off-topic replies. The AI needs to distinguish genuine complaints from casual mentions, extract the core problem from conversational text, identify recurring patterns, and score pain intensity. If extraction produces low-quality signals, the tool is worthless.</p>

      <h2>Verdict</h2>
      <p><strong>BUILD</strong> - with critical scope constraints.</p>

      <p><strong>Conviction level: Medium</strong> - because signals are genuinely mixed. Clear demand exists (people pay $29-$59/month for this), but GummySearch shutting down is a major red flag. We're betting we can succeed by: (1) using free RSS instead of paid API, (2) focusing on extraction quality over comprehensive coverage, (3) treating this as pipeline R&D not a standalone product.</p>

      <p><strong>Kill criteria by Wednesday:</strong> If pattern extraction produces >40% false positives, OR if RSS feed data is too limited, OR if the structured output isn't actually more useful than just spending 30 minutes browsing r/indiehackers manually.</p>

  <!-- SCOPE TAB -->
  <div id="scope" class="tab-content">
    <section class="article">
      <h2>Target Persona</h2>
      <p><strong>Who:</strong> Solo indie hackers and technical founders building 3+ MVPs per year, pre-PMF, who can code fast but struggle with customer discovery and validation. Typically bootstrapped, no budget for $59/month research tools.</p>

      <p><strong>Trigger moment:</strong> Monday morning. They have 2-3 product ideas and need to pick one to build this week. They know they should "do research" but dread spending hours scrolling Reddit looking for problem signals.</p>

      <p><strong>Current workaround:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manually browse r/Entrepreneur, r/startups, r/SaaS for 2-4 hours, copy-pasting interesting complaints into a doc</li>
        <li>Or skip research entirely and just start building (then pivot/abandon later)</li>
        <li>Or pay $29-$59/month for GummySearch/PainOnSocial (but hesitate due to cost)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>One Workflow</h2>
      <p><strong>Input:</strong> User selects 1-3 topic keywords (e.g., "SaaS pricing," "freelance burnout," "AI agents") OR uses the default "recent complaints" across all 5 curated subreddits.</p>

      <p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>System fetches last 7 days of posts from 5 curated subreddits via RSS feeds (r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, r/startups, r/indiehackers, r/ProductManagement)</li>
        <li>Filters posts by keyword relevance (if provided) and minimum engagement (>5 upvotes, >2 comments)</li>
        <li>Claude extracts pain points from post titles + top 3 comments per post</li>
        <li>AI scores each pain point 0-100 based on: intensity (frustration level), frequency (how often it appears), specificity (actionable vs vague)</li>
        <li>Groups similar pain points into clusters with source quotes</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Output:</strong> Structured markdown report with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Top 10 pain point clusters ranked by score</li>
        <li>2-3 supporting Reddit quotes per cluster (with post URLs)</li>
        <li>One-line summary of what people have tried and abandoned</li>
        <li>Estimated time to generate: 2-3 minutes</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Session length:</strong> 5-10 minutes total (30 seconds to input keywords, 2-3 min AI processing, 2-5 min reviewing output)</p>

      <h2>In Scope</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scrape 5 curated subreddits via RSS (last 7 days)</li>
        <li>AI-powered pain point extraction from posts + comments</li>
        <li>Scoring algorithm (intensity, frequency, specificity)</li>
        <li>Grouping similar pain points into clusters</li>
        <li>Markdown report with source attribution (Reddit post URLs)</li>
        <li>Optional keyword filtering</li>
        <li>Basic landing page explaining what it does</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Out of Scope (and Why)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom subreddit search</strong> — Requires expensive Reddit API, would kill us like it killed GummySearch. 5 curated subs is enough for MVP validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time monitoring</strong> — Weekly batch is sufficient for Monday research use case. Real-time adds complexity without proportional value.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical data (>7 days)</strong> — RSS feeds only provide recent posts. 7 days is enough signal.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-platform (HN, forums, Twitter)</strong> — Single platform tests if the concept works. Cross-platform is Layer 2-3 of the bigger pipeline.</li>
        <li><strong>User accounts / saved searches</strong> — No auth this week. Tool is stateless.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive analysis</strong> — That's Layer 2 (Competitive Teardown). This week only tests Layer 1.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>A stranger can visit the URL and generate a pain point report with zero instructions</li>
        <li>Extraction accuracy >60% - manually review 20 extracted pain points: at least 12/20 should be legitimate, actionable problem signals</li>
        <li>Processing completes in <3 minutes from submit to full report display</li>
        <li>We actually use it Monday - if we won't use our own tool for next week's research, it's not solving the problem</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Revenue Hypothesis</h2>
      <p><strong>Who would pay:</strong> Same persona - indie hackers doing weekly/monthly validation research. Also: product managers at early-stage startups, indie consultants doing client discovery.</p>

      <p><strong>What they'd pay:</strong> $10-20/month or $5 per report (one-time). We'd price lower than GummySearch ($29-$59/month) because: (1) limited to 5 subreddits not customizable, (2) weekly batch not real-time, (3) MVP quality. Customers paying for: time savings (2-3 hours) + pattern detection they'd miss manually.</p>

      <p><strong>When to test pricing:</strong> Week 2 or 3. This week: free, focus on "does the extraction work?" If 3+ people use it and say it's useful → add Stripe checkout next week.</p>

      <p><strong>Simplest payment test:</strong> Gumroad "Buy credits" button → 5 reports for $25. No subscription complexity, tests willingness to pay without ongoing billing headaches.</p>

      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <pre>PainPointCluster --&lt; SourceQuote  (one-to-many)</pre>
      <p>Each pain point cluster has 2-3 supporting source quotes. That's the only relationship. Everything else is ephemeral.</p>

      <h2>Auth & Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auth provider:</strong> None - completely public this week</li>
        <li><strong>Primary DB:</strong> None - stateless API this week</li>
        <li><strong>File storage:</strong> Not needed - reports are ephemeral</li>
        <li><strong>Caching:</strong> Optional - if scraping + extraction takes >3 minutes, cache SearchRequest results in memory (Node.js Map with TTL) to avoid re-processing identical requests within 1 hour</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Rationale for no DB:</strong> The workflow is "generate report" not "save my searches." Adding auth adds 2-3 hours of complexity for zero MVP value. Can always add Supabase next week if we want features like: save searches, compare over time, email digests.</p>

      <h2>What This Model Doesn't Cover (Intentionally)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User accounts — No auth, no user profiles</li>
        <li>Saved searches — No search history, no "my reports" page</li>
        <li>Custom subreddits — Hardcoded to 5 curated subs</li>
        <li>Report versioning — Can't compare "pain points this week vs last week"</li>
        <li>Billing/credits — No payment tracking</li>
        <li>Notification preferences — No "email me weekly reports"</li>
        <li>Analytics/usage tracking — Not tracking "which pain points get clicked most"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Stack</h2>
      <p><em>Ordered by "if this doesn't work, nothing else matters." Build in this order.</em></p>

      <h3>🔴 Risk 1: Pain Point Extraction Quality</h3>
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Claude needs to reliably extract actionable pain points from noisy Reddit threads (titles + top comments), distinguish real complaints from jokes/memes, and score them meaningfully (intensity, specificity).</p>

      <p><strong>Why it's risky:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reddit is 80% noise (memes, off-topic, sarcasm)</li>
        <li>Prompt engineering is unpredictable - might need 5-10 iterations to get acceptable quality</li>
        <li>"Actionable pain point" is subjective - hard to define programmatically</li>
        <li>If accuracy <60%, tool is worthless (fails success criteria)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Spike plan (Tuesday AM, 2 hours):</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Manually scrape 20 recent posts from r/Entrepreneur via RSS</li>
        <li>Write Claude prompt to extract pain points with scoring</li>
        <li>Run extraction on all 20 posts</li>
        <li>Manually review results: count true positives (real pain points) vs false positives (noise)</li>
        <li>Iterate prompt 3-4 times to improve accuracy</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Pass/fail:</strong> If we can achieve 12+/20 true positives (60% accuracy) after 4 prompt iterations, we're good. If still <60% after 4 iterations, either: (a) simplify extraction (remove scoring, just extract quotes), or (b) kill the project.</p>

      <h3>🟡 Risk 2: RSS Feed Data Volume & Reliability</h3>
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Reddit RSS feeds need to provide enough recent posts (20+ per subreddit) to extract patterns. Unclear if RSS feeds work consistently or if Reddit throttles them.</p>

      <p><strong>Why it's risky:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>RSS might only return 5-10 posts per sub (not enough for pattern detection)</li>
        <li>RSS might be delayed (12-24 hours old = stale signals)</li>
        <li>Reddit could block RSS access if we scrape too aggressively</li>
        <li>If RSS doesn't work, fallback is PRAW (free tier API) which adds complexity</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Pass/fail:</strong> If RSS returns 15+ posts per subreddit from last 7 days, we're good. If <10 posts/sub, add PRAW as backup source.</p>

      <h3>🟢 Risk 3: Processing Speed (<3 minutes)</h3>
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Full workflow (scrape 5 subs via RSS → filter posts → Claude extraction on 50-100 posts → group into clusters) must complete in under 3 minutes.</p>

      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Claude API streaming can help perceived speed. Parallel processing: scrape all 5 RSS feeds simultaneously. If too slow: add in-memory caching (1-hour TTL). This is lower risk because it's an optimization problem, not a "does it work at all" problem.</p>

      <h2>Build Sequence</h2>

      <h3>Tuesday: Prove the hard part</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SPIKE: Risk 1 & 2 by noon</strong> — Test extraction quality (60%+ accuracy) + RSS feed viability (15+ posts/sub)</li>
        <li>If pass: Scaffold Next.js project (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind)</li>
        <li>If extraction <60%: Iterate prompt OR simplify to "just extract quotes, skip scoring"</li>
        <li>If RSS fails: Integrate PRAW free tier as fallback</li>
        <li>Create basic API route: <code>/api/extract</code> that accepts keywords, returns mock data</li>
        <li>Simple form UI: keyword input + submit button</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>End of day:</strong> Extraction spike complete with proven accuracy + Next.js scaffold running locally. Can submit form and see mock response.</p>

      <h3>Wednesday: Core workflow end-to-end</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>RSS scraping function: fetch last 7 days from 5 subreddits, parse XML</li>
        <li>Filtering logic: min engagement (5 upvotes, 2 comments), keyword matching if provided</li>
        <li>Claude integration: send filtered posts → get back pain point clusters with scores</li>
        <li>Display results: Render markdown report in browser (clusters ranked by score, source quotes with URLs)</li>
        <li>Error handling: Show friendly error if scraping fails or Claude times out</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>End of day:</strong> Can enter keywords → get real extraction results → see ranked pain points with Reddit links. Workflow works end-to-end but ugly/slow is fine.</p>

      <h3>Thursday: Optimize & polish</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance: Parallel RSS fetching, streaming Claude responses, or add caching if >3 min</li>
        <li>Landing page: Explain what it does, show example output, "Try it" CTA</li>
        <li>UX improvements: Loading states, empty state (no results), copy markdown button</li>
        <li>Edge cases: No keywords provided (use defaults), zero results (better message), malformed RSS (graceful degradation)</li>
        <li>Manual QA: Test all 5 subreddits individually, test with different keywords</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>End of day:</strong> Tool is fast enough (<3 min), stranger can understand and use it, handles errors gracefully.</p>

      <h3>Friday morning: Ship</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Deploy to Vercel: <code>reddit-signals.theaiethos.com</code></li>
        <li>Verify deployment checklist: Custom domain, env vars (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY), smoke test production</li>
        <li>Smoke test: Fresh incognito browser, visit URL, run extraction with "SaaS pricing", verify results load</li>
        <li>Screenshot final output for documentation</li>
        <li>Use it ourselves: Generate a report for next Monday's research, confirm it's actually useful</li>
        <li>Fill out RETRO.md by EOD</li>

      <h2>Fallback Plans</h2>
      <p><strong>If Risk 1 fails (extraction accuracy <60%):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>First: Iterate prompt 3-4 times with different approaches (few-shot examples, stricter filtering, simpler scoring rubric)</li>
        <li>If still <60%: Simplify extraction - remove scoring, just extract raw quotes with source URLs. Still useful but less magical.</li>
        <li>If even quote extraction is poor (<40% useful): Kill the project. Problem signal extraction is the core value prop.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>If behind by Wednesday EOD (workflow not working):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cut clustering - just show flat list of pain points ranked by score</li>
        <li>Cut keyword filtering - only support "show me everything from these 5 subs"</li>
        <li>Cut score breakdown - just show composite score (0-100)</li>
        <li>Deploy Thursday AM with working but basic version</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>If AI output quality is poor (Thursday QA reveals issues):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prompt iteration budget: 6 attempts max (2 hours)</li>
        <li>After 6 attempts without improvement: Ship with disclaimer "Beta - extraction quality improving" and collect user feedback</li>
        <li>Add feedback buttons: "This was useful" / "This was noise" to gather training data</li>
