      <h2>What This Is</h2>

      <p>The structured process for taking a shipped MVP from "live URL" to evidence of demand or a kill decision. The Build Program optimizes for learning whether something can be built. The Growth Program optimizes for learning whether anyone cares.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <h3>Graduation Criteria</h3>
        <p>Projects enter Growth after their Friday Build Program retro if the answer to this question is "yes":</p>
        <p><strong>"Did anything about this week's build make me think there's a real user on the other side?"</strong></p>
        <p>If the answer is "no but I learned something useful," that's a valid Build Program success that doesn't need Growth.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Four Phases</h2>

      <div class="phase-grid">
        <div class="phase-card">
          <h3>Phase 1: Exposure</h3>
          <p>Get the MVP in front of 50-100 people who match the target persona. Small-scale distribution where you can observe behavior. Not a launch—targeted exposure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-card">
          <h3>Phase 2: Signal Collection</h3>
          <p>Understand what happened when people encountered the product. Track quantitative metrics (workflow completion, returns) and qualitative feedback (what they said, asked for, got confused by).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-card">
          <h3>Phase 3: Iteration</h3>
          <p>Make one targeted change based on signals. Not a redesign—one hypothesis about the biggest drop-off point. Time-boxed to 3 hours maximum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-card">
          <h3>Phase 4: Revenue Test</h3>
          <p>Learn if anyone will take a payment action. Not "would you pay?" but "here's the price, click buy." Tests willingness to pay, not ability to deliver a paid product yet.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>

      <p>After 4 weeks, one of three outcomes:</p>

      <div class="detail-grid" style="margin-top: 24px;">
        <div class="detail-item">
          <div class="label">Sustain</div>
          <div class="value">Revenue signal + returning users + clear path to $500 MRR. Becomes priority product. Gets Build Program weeks for feature development. Rare—maybe 1 in 10.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-item">
          <div class="label">Orbit</div>
          <div class="value">Some interest but not enough to invest heavily. Keep it live, monitor passively, revisit if signals change. Low-maintenance mode. Most "successful" builds.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-item">
          <div class="label">Kill</div>
          <div class="value">No signal. No workflow completions. No revenue action. Document learnings in VERDICT.md and move on. Not a failure—a data point for the Build Program.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Time Budget</h2>

      <p>Growth Program work cannot compete with Build Program days. Total: ~2-3 hours/week, mostly Monday PM and Friday PM. If a project needs more than 3 hours/week, it should either become the Build Program focus for a week or get killed.</p>

      <h2>Current Capacity</h2>

      <p>Start with 1 project at a time. Full attention, clean signal, learn the process. As the process matures, scale to 2-3 with lighter touch per project.</p>

      <h2>Active Projects</h2>

      <p class="empty-state">No projects in Growth yet. Projects will appear here after graduating from the Pre-build Intelligence Pipeline.</p>

  <div id="intake" class="tab-content">
    <section class="article">
      <h2>Growth Intake Template</h2>
      <p>Completed on Friday PM after deciding to graduate a project from Build Program. Captures handoff context and sets up hypotheses for the Growth cycle.</p>

      <pre># Growth Intake: [Project Name]

> **Graduated from Build Program:** [date]
> **Live URL:** [url]
> **Build Program RETRO summary:** [one sentence — what worked, what's uncertain]

---

## What It Does (for a stranger)

_One paragraph. If you can't explain it in 3 sentences, the product has a clarity problem that Growth can't fix._

## Who It's For

**Persona from SCOPE.md:** [copy]
**Refined after build:** [anything you learned during the build about who this is actually for]

## The Core Workflow

**Input →** [what the user provides]
**Output →** [what they get back]
**Time to value:** [how long from landing page to "this was useful"]

---

## Hypotheses Entering Growth

_What do you believe about this product that you haven't tested yet?_

### H1: People have this problem
**Evidence from research:** [strongest signal from RESEARCH.md]
**Still unproven:** [what you're assuming but haven't validated with real users]

### H2: This product solves it
**Evidence from build:** [did the workflow actually work? Any early testers?]
**Still unproven:** [does it solve it *well enough* that someone would use it over their current workaround?]

### H3: Someone would pay for this
**Pricing hypothesis:** [$X/month or one-time, based on competitor research]
**Comparable pricing:** [what do alternatives charge?]
**Still unproven:** [is the value clear enough to justify the price?]

---

## What Success Looks Like (4 weeks from now)

_Be specific. "People like it" is not a success criterion._

- [ ] [N] people completed the core workflow without guidance
- [ ] [N] people returned without prompting
- [ ] [N] people took a payment action (clicked buy, booked a call, etc.)
- [ ] Qualitative: [specific feedback that would validate the thesis]

## What Would Kill It

_What signal, if you saw it in 4 weeks, would make you kill this project?_

-
-

---

## Pre-Growth Checklist

_Before starting exposure, these must be in place:_

- [ ] Analytics installed (Plausible / Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Custom event tracking: `workflow_completed` fires when user finishes core action
- [ ] Landing page clearly explains what the product does in < 10 seconds
- [ ] No login required to see what it does (demo, example output, or video)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive (people clicking Reddit/Twitter links are on phones)
- [ ] Error states handled (bad input doesn't break the product)</pre>

      <h2>Distribution Template</h2>
      <p>Completed Monday PM of Week 1. Plans where to get 50-100 people matching the persona to see the product within 7 days.</p>

      <pre># Distribution Plan: [Project Name]

> **Target:** 50-100 people matching the persona see this product within 7 days
> **Budget:** $0. Distribution through content and communities, not ads.
> **Time budget:** 2 hours to plan, 1 hour to execute, then monitor.

---

## Persona Recap

**Who:** [from INTAKE.md]
**Where they hang out online:** [subreddits, Slack groups, Discord servers, Twitter communities, forums]
**What they search for:** [Google queries they'd use when experiencing this problem]
**How they describe the problem:** [their language, not yours — pull from RESEARCH.md quotes]

---

## Channel Plan

_Pick 2-3 channels. Not all of them. Concentrated effort > scattered presence._

### Channel 1: [e.g., r/freelance]

**Post format:** [Question? Show & Tell? Tutorial?]
**Draft hook:** [First sentence of the post — this determines whether anyone clicks]

_The hook should describe the PROBLEM, not the product. "I was tired of X so I built Y" works. "Check out my new app" doesn't._

**Post draft:**
```
[Write the actual post here. Keep it under 200 words.
Include the problem, what you built, link, and an ask:
"would love feedback from people who deal with this"]
```

**When to post:** [Day/time — check subreddit patterns]
**Expected reach:** [rough estimate based on sub size and typical post engagement]

### Channel 2: [e.g., Indie Hackers]

**Post format:**
**Draft hook:**
**Post draft:**
```

```
**When to post:**
**Expected reach:**

### Channel 3: [e.g., Direct outreach]

**Who:** [Specific people from RESEARCH.md who complained about this problem]
**Message draft:**
```
[Short DM. 2-3 sentences. "Hey, I saw your post about [problem].
I built something that might help: [link]. Would love your take on it."]
```
**Number of people to contact:** [10-20]

---

## What NOT To Do

- Don't post in more than 3 channels in week 1. You need to be able to trace which channel drove which signal.
- Don't ask "would you use this?" Ask "try it and tell me where you got stuck."
- Don't mention it's an MVP or that you built it in a week. That frames it as unfinished instead of focused.
- Don't pay for ads yet. If organic distribution can't get 50 eyeballs, the positioning is wrong.

---

## Tracking

| Channel | Date posted | Link | Views | Clicks | Signups | Workflow completions |
|---------|------------|------|-------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |

_Fill this in over the week. The ratio of clicks → completions is the most important number._

---

## Backup Plan

_If week 1 channels produce < 20 visits:_

- [ ] Rewrite the hook (the problem framing isn't resonating)
- [ ] Try a different channel from the list above
- [ ] Post at a different time
- [ ] Consider: is this a distribution problem or a "nobody has this problem" problem?</pre>

## Qualitative Signals

### What People Said

_Actual quotes. Not your interpretation. Copy-paste from Reddit comments, DMs, emails, tweets._

| Date | Source | Quote | Signal type |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| | | | positive / negative / confused / feature request |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### What People Asked For

| | | yes / no |
| | | |
| | | |

### What Confused People

_Where did they get stuck? What did they misunderstand?_

| Confusion point | How you know | Severity |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| | [analytics, comment, DM] | blocks workflow / slows workflow / cosmetic |
| | | |
| | | |

---

## Returning Users

_The most important signal. Someone who comes back without prompting has found value._

| User/identifier | First visit | Return visit(s) | What they did on return |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Signal Summary (update weekly)

### Week 1 read:
_One paragraph. What's the honest read on the signals so far? Not what you hope — what the data says._

  <div id="iteration" class="tab-content">
    <section class="article">
      <h2>Iteration Template</h2>
      <p>Completed Week 2-3. Makes one targeted change based on signal data. Time-boxed to 3 hours maximum build time.</p>

      <pre># Iteration: [Project Name]

> **Based on:** SIGNALS.md week [N] read
> **Time budget:** 3 hours maximum build time
> **Date:** [date]

---

## The Problem

**Biggest funnel drop-off:** [where people leave]
**Evidence:** [analytics data, quotes, observation]
**Current experience at this point:** [what the user sees/does right before dropping off]

## Hypothesis

_"I believe [specific change] will [improve specific metric] because [reasoning based on signal data]."_

**Change:** [exactly what you're going to do]
**Metric to watch:** [one number that tells you if it worked]
**Current baseline:** [what that metric is today]
**Target:** [what would "worked" look like?]

---

## What You're NOT Changing

_List things you're tempted to fix but are explicitly not touching this cycle. One change at a time._

- ~~[Thing 1]~~ — not this cycle because [reason]
- ~~[Thing 2]~~ — not this cycle because [reason]

---

## Implementation

**What to build/change:**
- [ ] [Concrete task 1]
- [ ] [Concrete task 2]

**Deploy by:** [date/time]
**Measurement window:** [how long before you check results — minimum 72 hours]

---

## Result

**Metric before:** [baseline]
**Metric after:** [post-change, measured after window]
**Δ:** [change]

**Did it work?**
- [ ] Yes — the hypothesis was right. Keep the change.
- [ ] Partially — metric improved but not to target. Note why.
- [ ] No — metric didn't move or got worse. Revert or accept.

**What this tells you:**
_One sentence. What did you learn about the user or the product?_

---

## Next Iteration (if warranted)

_Based on this result, is another iteration needed? Or is the product ready for revenue test?_</pre>
    </section>
  </div>

  <div id="revenue" class="tab-content">
    <section class="article">
      <h2>Revenue Test Template</h2>
      <p>Completed Week 3-4. Tests willingness to pay, not ability to deliver a paid product. Measurement window: 7-14 days.</p>

      <pre># Revenue Test: [Project Name]

> **Date started:** [date]
> **Pricing hypothesis from INTAKE.md:** [$X/month or one-time]
> **Measurement window:** 7-14 days

---

## Pricing Decision

**Price:** [$X]
**Model:** [one-time / monthly / usage-based / pay-what-you-want]
**Rationale:** [why this price? based on competitor pricing, perceived value, gut]

**Comparison:**
| Alternative | Their price | What they offer | Why yours is different |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**The "would I pay this?" test:** [Honestly — if you had this problem, would $X feel fair?]

---

## Payment Mechanism

_Simplest viable option. Don't overbuild._

**Method:** [Stripe Checkout / LemonSqueezy / Gumroad / Cal.com / "Email me"]

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Payment link or button created
- [ ] Placed where? [landing page, after workflow completion, both]
- [ ] What happens after payment? [immediate access / email / nothing yet]
- [ ] Confirmation/receipt handled by [payment provider / manual]

**Setup time:** [should be < 1 hour]

---

## What the User Sees

**Before paywall:** [what's free? full workflow? limited workflow? demo only?]
**The ask:** [exact copy on the button/section — e.g., "Get unlimited reports — $9/month"]
**After payment:** [what do they get that they didn't have before?]

_If nothing changes after payment yet, that's fine for a test. You're measuring willingness to pay, not delivering a paid product._

---

## Results

### Raw Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Saw pricing/payment option | |
| Clicked "buy" / payment button | |
| Reached checkout page | |
| Completed payment | |
| Total revenue | |

### Conversion Funnel

- Saw price → Clicked buy: __%
- Clicked buy → Completed payment: __%
- Overall saw price → paid: __%

### Qualitative

**Did anyone ask about pricing before you showed it?** [yes/no — organic price inquiry is a strong signal]
**What did people say about the price?** [quotes]
**Did anyone ask for a different model?** [e.g., "I'd pay per use but not monthly"]

---

## Revenue Signal Assessment

- [ ] **Strong signal:** Someone paid. Repeat.
- [ ] **Moderate signal:** People clicked buy but didn't complete. Explore why — price? trust? friction?
- [ ] **Mild signal:** Someone asked about pricing unprompted. Interest exists, mechanism is wrong.
- [ ] **No signal:** Nobody engaged with pricing at all. Product isn't solving a problem people value with money.

**Honest read:**
_One paragraph. Is this a product people will pay for? Not "could" — will._

---

## If Revenue Signal is Strong

- [ ] Set up proper billing (if using a hacky test method)
- [ ] Plan next Build Program week focused on this product's paid features
- [ ] Define path to $500 MRR: how many customers at what price?

## If Revenue Signal is Weak

- [ ] Is it a pricing problem? (Would a different price change behavior?)
- [ ] Is it a positioning problem? (Do people understand what they're paying for?)
- [ ] Is it a product problem? (Is the free version not compelling enough to upgrade from?)
- [ ] Is it a market problem? (Nobody will pay for this. Kill it.)</pre>

| Total unique visitors | |
| Workflow completions | |
| Completion rate (visit → complete) | |
| Return visitors | |
| Payment actions (clicked buy) | |
| Paying customers | |

### Qualitative

**Strongest positive signal:** [quote or observation]
**Strongest negative signal:** [quote or observation]
**Most common feedback theme:** [what kept coming up]

### Iteration Results

**Change made:** [what you changed in Phase 3]
**Impact:** [did it move the metric?]

---

## Decision

### [ ] Sustain

**Why:** [revenue signal + returning users + clear path to growth]
**Next steps:**
- [ ] Dedicate next Build Program week to paid features
- [ ] Set MRR target: $[X] by [date]
- [ ] Define the 3 features that would make someone pay more / tell a friend
- [ ] Move to ongoing product status in project tracker

### [ ] Orbit

**Why:** [some interest, not enough to invest, but worth keeping live]
**Maintenance plan:**
- [ ] Keep deployed — no active development
- [ ] Check analytics monthly (calendar reminder)
- [ ] Revisit if: [specific trigger that would change the decision]
- [ ] Auto-kill after [N months] of no engagement

### [ ] Kill

**Why:** [no signal, wrong market, better idea came along]
**What to preserve:**
- [ ] Document learnings for future builds
- [ ] Any reusable code/components → template library
- [ ] Any validated problem signals → Build Program backlog

---

## What This Taught the Incubator

_The Growth Program's purpose isn't just to validate individual products. It's to make the Build Program better. What did this cycle teach you about what to build next?_

### About the problem space:
_[Was this problem real? Were you right about who has it?]_

### About distribution:
_[Which channels worked? Which didn't? What positioning resonated?]_

### About pricing:
_[What did you learn about willingness to pay in this space?]_

### About the Growth Program itself:
_[What template needs to change? What step was useless? What was missing?]_

---

## Template Changes

_Based on this cycle, what changes to Growth Program templates for next time?_

### Add:
