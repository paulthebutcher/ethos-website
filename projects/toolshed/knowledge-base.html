    <p>
      Weekly products are one-off bets. Some succeed, most fail. But every build generates learnings — about markets, about technical approaches, about what signals actually matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knowledge Base captures these learnings in a structured format that compounds. After 50 builds, this isn't a notes folder. It's a decision-making advantage that makes every future build systematically better.

    <div class="section-label">What gets captured</div>
    <p>
      Every other Toolshed component feeds into the Knowledge Base:
    </p>
    <div class="principles">
      <div class="principle">
        <strong>Decision patterns</strong>
        <span>What types of ideas work? What red flags predict failure?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="principle">
        <strong>Technical learnings</strong>
        <span>Which stacks work for which problems? What patterns saved time?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="principle">
        <strong>Market signals</strong>
        <span>What actually drove revenue? What seemed promising but wasn't?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="principle">
        <strong>Process improvements</strong>
        <span>What checkpoint types caught real issues? What was theater?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="principle">
        <strong>Design patterns</strong>
        <span>What UI approaches worked? What can be reused?</span>

    <div class="section-label">How it's used</div>
    <p>
      The Knowledge Base is an MCP server, queryable by AI and humans:
    </p>
    <div class="non-negotiables">
      <div class="non-negotiable">
        <span class="nn-icon">◆</span>
        <span class="nn-text"><strong>Pre-build</strong> — "What do we know about this market from previous experiments?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="non-negotiable">
        <span class="nn-icon">◆</span>
        <span class="nn-text"><strong>During build</strong> — "Have we solved this technical problem before?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="non-negotiable">
        <span class="nn-icon">◆</span>
        <span class="nn-text"><strong>Post-launch</strong> — "What signals correlated with success in similar experiments?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="non-negotiable">
        <span class="nn-icon">◆</span>
        <span class="nn-text"><strong>Retrospective</strong> — "What patterns are emerging across builds?"</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <div class="section-label">The compound effect</div>
    <div class="moat-callout">
      <p>
        This is the moat. After 50 builds, the Knowledge Base contains:
      </p>
      <ul class="output-list">
        <li>50+ decision records with outcomes</li>
        <li>Patterns for what works in specific markets</li>
        <li>Technical solutions battle-tested across projects</li>
        <li>Design patterns proven to convert</li>
        <li>Signal patterns that predict success/failure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This isn't information that can be copied. It's proprietary judgment, accumulated through real experiments, structured for retrieval.

      <p><strong>Current:</strong> Designing the schema. Every build generates learnings that will eventually feed into this system.</p>
      <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Start with manual capture. Automate ingestion once patterns stabilize.</p>
