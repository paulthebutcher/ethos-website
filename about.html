  <div class="about-content">
    <p>I'm Paul — a product strategist who builds things. Most recently I was Director of Product Experience Strategy at Mastercard, where I led strategy across 13 products in a $1B+ Cyber & Intelligence portfolio and grew my team from 1 to 8 people. Before product, I studied chemical engineering, which means I've always been wired to build end-to-end rather than just strategize from the sidelines.</p>

    <p>Right now I'm learning new domains by building AI products in them. One per week. The approach is simple: pick something I don't know well, build a tool that solves a real problem in that space, and sell it. Revenue is the validation that I actually learned something useful.</p>

    <p><strong>I operate under a "get paid to learn" philosophy.</strong> I'd rather build a rough first version in an unfamiliar domain than study that domain for six months. The act of shipping forces clarity. Selling forces accountability. Both teach faster than research alone.</p>

    <p>This isn't a startup. It's not freelancing either. Think of it as an incubator of one. I build products, sell them, and use what I learn to make the next build faster. Each week's work compounds into better instincts, better infrastructure, and — eventually — better products.</p>

    <p>The pace is sustainable by design. No hustle culture. No "rise and grind." Just consistent output, week after week, with space to think and adjust.</p>
