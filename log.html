          Scrapped evidence-scoring-layer approach. Research showed cross-engine corroboration is a thin moat and the real bottleneck is idea → spec, not idea → evidence. Reframed as pre-build intelligence system. Running manually before automating.

          <span class="tag">research</span>
          Deep dive into academic claim decomposition pipelines (FActScore, VeriScore, SAFE, DecMetrics). Validated that decomposition prompt quality is the bottleneck, not scoring algorithms. VeriScore's sliding window + verifiability filtering is the right starting pattern.

          Competitive landscape analysis: Elicit, Scite, Consensus all academic-focused. Nobody building idea → build-spec pipeline. The evidence layer is commodity; structuring evidence into actionable build plans is the gap.

          <span class="tag">launchpad</span>
          Built full Launchpad UI at launchpad.theaiethos.com with dark theme. AI proposal generation: describe idea → get full app config. Proposal editor with tabs, build progress page with SSE streaming. Fixed Clerk middleware, restructured CSS to app-level styling.

          Phase 1 complete. Built Blueprint (conversational project scoping), Bench (talent network), Retro (retrospectives). Full MVP loop: Scope → Staff → Deliver → Learn → Improve. All three modules in ~3 hours across 2 sessions — validates 1 MVP/week pace.

          Launched standalone ethos site. Built /projects page with status badges, /log page for ongoing documentation. Established weekly log cadence. AI-assisted development is 10-20x faster than traditional estimates — Phase 0 took half a day vs 3 week estimate.

          <span class="tag">guildry</span>
          Phase 0 complete. Clerk auth, Supabase with RLS, Claude API integration. AI creates clients via natural conversation. Pivoted from 17-PR waterfall to discovery-first approach — let AI conversations reveal what data matters.

          Previous iteration: Plinth as strategic research tool for consultants. Positioning defined but product scope kept expanding. Five build attempts with mixed results — consistent pattern of spec quality being the limiting factor.
