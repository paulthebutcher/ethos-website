          Major reframe: from "pre-build intelligence pipeline" to "The Toolshed" — an MCP-first platform where the system that builds products is the product. The compound asset is the Knowledge Base MCP, not the individual products. Human checkpoints at decision points, full AI autonomy elsewhere.

      <div class="log-entry">
        <span class="log-date">11 Feb</span>
        <span class="log-text">
          <span class="tag">architecture</span>
          Expanded Toolshed to 26 MCP components across 7 layers: Discover (Signal Miner, Market Scanner, Tech Scout), Validate (Decision Framework, Scope Definer, Spec Generator, Architecture Planner), Build (Repo Scaffold, Code Orchestrator, Asset Generator, Docs Generator, Human Checkpoints), Quality (Test Runner, Security Scanner, Design Review, Accessibility Gate), Ship (Deploy Pipeline, Launch Coordinator, Analytics Setup), Measure (Signal Tracker, Feedback Collector, Health Monitor, Portfolio Framework), and The Compound Layer (Knowledge Base MCP, Pattern Library, Context Sync).

          Week 1 kickoff: Reddit Problem Signal Miner. Tests whether AI can extract actionable problem signals from startup communities. Validates the "problem discovery" piece of Layer 1.

          <span class="tag">pivot</span>
          Scrapped evidence-scoring-layer approach. Research showed cross-engine corroboration is a thin moat and the real bottleneck is idea → spec, not idea → evidence. Reframed as pre-build intelligence system. Running manually before automating.

      <div class="log-entry">
        <span class="log-date">09 Feb</span>
        <span class="log-text">
          <span class="tag">research</span>
          Deep dive into academic claim decomposition pipelines (FActScore, VeriScore, SAFE, DecMetrics). Validated that decomposition prompt quality is the bottleneck, not scoring algorithms. VeriScore's sliding window + verifiability filtering is the right starting pattern.

        <span class="log-text">
          <span class="tag">research</span>
          Competitive landscape analysis: Elicit, Scite, Consensus all academic-focused. Nobody building idea → build-spec pipeline. The evidence layer is commodity; structuring evidence into actionable build plans is the gap.
        </span>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <span class="log-date">08 Feb</span>
        <span class="log-text">
          <span class="tag">launchpad</span>
          Built full Launchpad UI at launchpad.theaiethos.com with dark theme. AI proposal generation: describe idea → get full app config. Proposal editor with tabs, build progress page with SSE streaming. Fixed Clerk middleware, restructured CSS to app-level styling.
        </span>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <span class="log-date">07 Feb</span>
        <span class="log-text">
          <span class="tag">guildry</span>
          Phase 1 complete. Built Blueprint (conversational project scoping), Bench (talent network), Retro (retrospectives). Full MVP loop: Scope → Staff → Deliver → Learn → Improve. All three modules in ~3 hours across 2 sessions — validates 1 MVP/week pace.
        </span>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <span class="log-date">06 Feb</span>
        <span class="log-text">
          <span class="tag">ethos</span>
          Launched standalone ethos site. Built /projects page with status badges, /log page for ongoing documentation. Established weekly log cadence. AI-assisted development is 10-20x faster than traditional estimates — Phase 0 took half a day vs 3 week estimate.

        <span class="log-text">
          <span class="tag">guildry</span>
          Phase 0 complete. Clerk auth, Supabase with RLS, Claude API integration. AI creates clients via natural conversation. Pivoted from 17-PR waterfall to discovery-first approach — let AI conversations reveal what data matters.
        </span>
      </div>

      <div class="log-entry">

          <span class="tag">context</span>
          Previous iteration: Plinth as strategic research tool for consultants. Positioning defined but product scope kept expanding. Five build attempts with mixed results — consistent pattern of spec quality being the limiting factor.
